The Status code of 301 in turn means that the page has been permanently moved to a new location.  2. Abandonment In eCommerce, this term means a visitor has visited the website and have left the webpage without making a desired action.

A/B Testing A/B Testing is a method used by website development companies to compare two web pages to determine which one performs better.

Thus this mechanism helps to figure out the best online promotional and marketing strategies for online business.  A/B Testing is also called as Split Testing and can be used on popups and emails too.  Example – Humana’s banner testing example clearly reveals the effectiveness of A/B testing in increasing the clickthroughs.  image05 2-15 eCommerce Terms Every Store Owner Should Know [Glossary]                                                                          Source  The above image shows two banners displayed on Humana’s homepage which underwent A/B testing. The 1st banner looked cluttered with ample of copy & paragraphs and less noticeable CTA button. Whereas the 2nd banner had a clear indication of the purpose with a strong CTA to support it.  The result of the testing showed 433% increase in clickthroughs for 2nd banner variation that had clean design and up to the point copy. After making a little more variations in the microcopy on the CTA button, it helped them achieve an increase in the clicks by further 192%.  4.

Affiliate An affiliate is a type of inter-company relationship where one firm sells other merchants’ products on his own website. An affiliate can be termed as a commercial partner of the merchant who promotes the merchant’s products and services on his website by means of different visual tools.

Application Programming Interface (API) An API is a set of protocols, specifications or instructions allowing two software applications to interact and exchange data. It is used for developing software applications where it acts as an interface between different software programs and allows interaction.

Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.  8. Authorization This is a process of granting permission to someone to allow them to give orders or make decisions or take an action.  Example – In multi-user systems, there is a right given to system administrator to define roles for different users which gives them  access to the system and privileges for the use of certain file directories or system data. This is called as giving authority to the users to perform an action.  Thus, authorization is seen as both; the setting up of permissions by a system administrator and the actual checking of the permission values that have been set up when a user is getting access.  9. Average Time on Site Average Time on Site is mostly seen in web analytics report which refers to the amount of time the visitor has spent on the webpage they visited while browsing. This is the time measured in minutes or seconds and can be misleading in the analytics report sometimes, because it does not calculate the actual reading time of the visitor on the webpage.  The accurate time on the webpage cannot be estimated as there could be instances when the visitor may be interacting with the pages and site content or they could have left the browser window open and were not actually viewing the webpage.  Example – If Average Time on Site is calculated as 10 seconds for a long blog post, then it is assumed, that visitors are not reading the post unless in a rare case you have an extremely fast reader reading it.  10. B2B (Business to Business) In eCommerce, B2B is referred to as exchange of products and services between two businesses. It is a situation where one business commercially transacts with the other business. It could be a manufacturer with wholesaler, or a wholesaler with a retailer.  B2B decision making may take place at more than one level. For instance, when a salesperson meets with the departmental manager to bring about sale, the departmental manager has to get approval from the business owner before the proposed sale is closed.  11. B2C (Business to Consumer) In contrast to B2B, Business to Consumer (B2C) refers to a business or transaction that is conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services.  Websites that offer consumer products are B2C.  Example – A mother is looking for educational toys. She finds the website, reviews the product and buys the toy. Thus this business model refers business as a website, consumer as the mother and product as a toy. Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc are some of the best suited B2C examples.  The term B2C became immensely popular during the dotcom boom in the late 1990s. During that time, businesses were referred as online retailers, or companies that sold products and services to consumers through the internet.  12. Blog A blog is nothing but an informal conversational style of information or a discussion which is updated regularly on a website or a webpage and is run by an individual or a small group.  The word blog was derived from the combination of the word Web and Log.

Bounce Rate Bounce Rate is expressed in percentage and refers to the percentage of visitors who navigate away from the website without visiting other pages of the site.

Example – Let us look at how Google Analytics calculates Bounce Rate.  slack imgs com-15 eCommerce Terms Every Store Owner Should Know [Glossary] Stats from Tyche Software’s Google Analytics  This shows that Bounce Rate is calculated specifically upon session triggers. A bounce is called a single-page session which implies that only a single request has been sent to the Analytics server. This is because a user opens one page on the site and exits without triggering any other request to the server in the same session.  Bounce Rate as per Google Analytics is calculated as a percentage of all sessions in which users visited only a single page without sending any other request to the Analytics server. Length of such single-page sessions is for 0 seconds duration as the Analytics is unable to track the session as no other hits are made after the first one.  14. Bottom of the Funnel Bottom of the Funnel is referred to as a Transaction phase or Purchase stage of the online buying process. At this stage the visitor has done all the research and is about to make a purchase, thus leading ahead to become a ‘New Customer’.  Bottom of the Funnel if preceded by the ‘Top of the Funnel‘ which means product/service comparison stage and the ‘Middle of the Funnel‘  which means validation stage.  15.
